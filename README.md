# COVID WebApp
This project is intended to be a "learning by doing" experience for the developer team.
This was a learning-oriented project done by the devolepers to learn more about git, flask, dash, plotly, deployment,etc and to get the practical experience handling a project. The whole project was done with the data from COVID INDIA API. In this 
project we created visualization of COVID and vaccination status which includes the statewise Deathrate,Tested cases,Confirmed cases,Recovered cases,Deceased Cases.
Plotly, being more sophisticated is used as data visualization tool  for creating elaborate plots more efficiently.

## Documentation
This project aims to create a covid webapp.It is a "learning by doing"experience which provided us the practical experience handling of git,flask,plotly,dash,deployment etc.This project was done with data from COVID INDIA API.This covid webapp provides the visualizations of vaccination status of different states of India along with the statewise Deathrate,Tested cases,Confirmed cases,Recovered cases,Deceased Cases.Thus making  an efficient way of comparison.
statewise Deathrate is plotted in bar chart 
Clicking on a bar in the bar chart makes changes in the adjacent pie chart. (APP Feature) 
Clicking on a legend item of the pie chart makes that item disappear (You can use this feature to sell total vs partially vaccinated). (DASH Feature)
In the state comparison tab, selecting no state will result in the line chart of India. (APP Feature)
In the state comparison tab, the Search option is available. (DASH Feature)
